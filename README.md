# Headless Open3D
Pre-compiled [Open3D](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D) for headless execution.

Every once in a while, we trigger a github action to build the library and publish it in this repository's _Releases_.

The library can then be unzipped and installed in your project with `poetry install ./open3d' or through pip.
